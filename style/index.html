<h3 id="structure-of-the-competency-index">Structure of the Competency Index</h3>
<p>The Competency Index is structured into <em>topics</em> (and higher-level <em>topic
clusters</em>), <em>competencies</em>, and <em>benchmarks</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Topics</strong>.  A topic is a theme under which a set of competencies are grouped,
such as <em>Designing RDF-based vocabularies</em> and <em>Maintaining RDF vocabularies</em>.
Topics are grouped under higher-level topic clusters, such as <em>RDF vocabularies
and application profiles</em>.  </p>
<p><strong>Competencies</strong>.  A competency is a brief phrase characterizing knowledge
(facts, insights, habits of mind, or skills) that may be learned.
Competencies may be used as building blocks for constructing self-learning
plans, university courses, or even entire curricula.  Under the topic <em>Querying
RDF Data</em>, for example, one finds two competencies:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Understands that a SPARQL query matches an RDF graph against a pattern of
  triples with fixed and variable values.</em></li>
<li><em>Understands the basic syntax of a SPARQL query.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benchmarks</strong>.  A benchmark is a brief phrase describing an action that can
demonstrate accomplishment in a given competency.  If competencies are about
learning, benchmarks are about doing.  Benchmarks may be used for devising
homework assignments, exam questions, or self-testing checklists.  Under the
competency <em>Understands the basic syntax of a SPARQL query</em>, for example, one
finds three benchmarks:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Uses angle brackets for delimiting URIs.</em></li>
<li><em>Uses question marks for indicating variables.</em></li>
<li><em>Uses PREFIX for base URIs.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The strictly topical structure of the Competency Index entailed the following 
design choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CI avoids classifying competencies or benchmarks by level of difficulty
  because it makes no particular assumptions about the background or skills
  sets of learners.  Concepts that are comparatively easy for a library science 
  student may be hard for a computer science student, and vice versa.</li>
<li>The CI avoids implying an inherent order to the topics.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="writing-effective-competencies-and-benchmarks">Writing effective competencies and benchmarks</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Limit each competency or benchmark to one sentence of circa 140 characters,
   the length of a Twitter posting.  If a thought seems to require more words,
   consider splitting it into two simpler thoughts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Begin each competency or benchmark with an action verb.  Competencies, which
   are about learning and understanding, start with verbs such as <em>understands</em>,
   <em>knows</em>, <em>recognizes</em>, or <em>differentiates</em>.  Benchmarks, which are about
   doing, start with verbs such as <em>uses</em>, <em>expresses</em>, or <em>demonstrates, 
   or with more task-specific verbs such as _distills</em> or
   <em>converts</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spell out acronyms at least once.  For example, the competency that
   introducing OWL says: <em>Knows Web Ontology Language, or OWL (2004), an RDF
   vocabulary of properties and classes that extend support for expressive data
   modeling and automated inferencing (reasoning).</em>  Use your judgement in this
   regard; in a competency index about Linked Data, frequently used acronyms
   such as <em>OWL</em> and <em>URI</em> need only be spelled out once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include historical context if possible.  Linked Data technology has largely
   evolved over the past quarter century and continues to evolve.  Knowing the
   year when a technology or concept was introduced helps readers, for example:
   <em>World Wide Web (1989)</em>, <em>HTTP (1991+)</em>, <em>URIs (1994)</em>, <em>OWL (2004)</em>, and 
   <em>Linked Data (2006)</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include enough detail to characterize the nature of competency in a domain.
   Competencies and benchmarks should not aim at covering all features of a
   technology, in the manner of a reference manual.  Attempts at
   comprehensiveness risk making the CI brittle in the face of inevitable
   change, and they risk making the CI boring to read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draw attention to ambiguity in the definition or use of terminology.  One 
   competency reads: <em>Knows that the word "ontology" is amiguous, referring to 
   any RDF vocabulary, but more typically a set of OWL classes and properties 
   designed to support inferencing in a specific domain</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enlarge the set of topics covered by the CI with prudence, bearing in mind
   adding topic clusters enlarges the scope of the CI as a whole.  The starter
   set of topics for this CI were originally brainstormed in 2012, at a
   workshop of experts convened by a previous IMLS-funded project, Learning
   Linked Data, and there is no expectation that this scope will remain static.
   For example, there is a recognized need to define competencies related to
   knowledge organization systems, but this feels like a topic big enough to 
   require its own competency index.</p>
