### Linked Data Competency Index

This is the back-end repository used to generate a [documentation website](https://dcmi.github.io/ldci/) for the Linked Data Competency Index.  The website also supports the maintenance of the index by crowdsourcing.

Processes not covered in the website:

@@@ Running the Python script to generate the Markdown version of the index.  Assumes Python 3.

@@@ Running [mkdocs](http://mkdocs.org) to generate and push the website from Markdown sources. Link to installation.

@@@ Using the ASN Editor to make changes to the competency index.

@@@ [Clarify with Joseph!] Mechanism by which Joseph is informed of changes to the [master JSON file]( index so that the ASN website can be updated.
