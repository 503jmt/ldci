The Competency Index for Linked Data (CI) will be composed of a set of
topically arranged assertions of the knowledge, skills and habits of mind
required for professional practice in the area of Linked Data. The structure of
the CI under development is as follows:

Topical Cluster => Topic => Competency => Benchmark

This structure is illustrated on the Learning Resources page. CI development is
expected to openly crowd-source expertise in the development processes under
the guidance of the project’s CI Editorial Board (CIEB).

The primary goal of the RDF-modeled CI is to provide a means for mapping
learning resources descriptions to the competencies those resources address to
assist in finding, identifying, and election resources appropriate to specific
learning needs. In the example of the CI on the Learning Resources page,
individual nodes are followed by number (e.g. “(4)”) indicating the number of
test mappings of actual learning resource descriptions to the
competency/benchmark.

For a published example of this same four-part topical/competency model being
followed in the CI, see the Competency Index for the Library Field in the U.S.
ASN-D2L triplestore — click the expansion icon for a full view of the
individual assertions; click on a specific assertion to see the assertion’s
metadata description on the right. Additional information on the project and
its development can be found here on the Exploring Linked Data website under
Briefing Papers — see in particular LD4PE Overview.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

The example CI on the Learning Resources page is test data illustrating the
project’s developing functionality and will be totally replaced as the CI
Editorial Board advances its work in the coming months.  The CI development
work is being partially funded through an IMLS National Leadership Grant for
Libraries.

The Competency Index for Linked Data (CI) constitutes a set of topically

Competency Index.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

The CI on this page is is a work in progress. The CI Editorial Board (CIEB) is
developing the competencies and benchmarks and anticipates completion of the CI
by June 2016. As sections of competencies are approved by the CIEB, they are
added to the version of the CI on the left and learning resources are mapped to
it.  The CI development work is being partially funded through an IMLS National
Leadership Grant for Libraries.
