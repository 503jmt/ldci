The Competency Index for Linked Data (CI) will be composed of a set of
topically arranged assertions of the knowledge, skills and habits of mind
required for professional practice in the area of Linked Data. The structure of
the CI under development is as follows:

Topical Cluster => Topic => Competency => Benchmark

This structure is illustrated on the Learning Resources page. CI development is
expected to openly crowd-source expertise in the development processes under
the guidance of the project’s CI Editorial Board (CIEB).

The primary goal of the RDF-modeled CI is to provide a means for mapping
learning resources descriptions to the competencies those resources address to
assist in finding, identifying, and election resources appropriate to specific
learning needs. In the example of the CI on the Learning Resources page,
individual nodes are followed by number (e.g. “(4)”) indicating the number of
test mappings of actual learning resource descriptions to the
competency/benchmark.

For a published example of this same four-part topical/competency model being
followed in the CI, see the Competency Index for the Library Field in the U.S.
ASN-D2L triplestore — click the expansion icon for a full view of the
individual assertions; click on a specific assertion to see the assertion’s
metadata description on the right. Additional information on the project and
its development can be found here on the Exploring Linked Data website under
Briefing Papers — see in particular LD4PE Overview.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

The example CI on the Learning Resources page is test data illustrating the
project’s developing functionality and will be totally replaced as the CI
Editorial Board advances its work in the coming months.  The CI development
work is being partially funded through an IMLS National Leadership Grant for
Libraries.

The Competency Index for Linked Data (CI) constitutes a set of topically

Competency Index.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

The CI on this page is is a work in progress. The CI Editorial Board (CIEB) is
developing the competencies and benchmarks and anticipates completion of the CI
by June 2016. As sections of competencies are approved by the CIEB, they are
added to the version of the CI on the left and learning resources are mapped to
it.  The CI development work is being partially funded through an IMLS National
Leadership Grant for Libraries.

Requesting Changes

The mechanism for requesting a change of any type to Schema.org is to raise a
Github Pull Request.  Each new release of Schema.org is assembled by the
organising team reviewing and hopefully accepting each Pull Request. You can
see the current list of requests awaiting acceptance in Github.  To stop the
comments associated with individual requests getting out of hand, and to make
it easier to track progress, the preferred way of working is to raise a Pull
Request as a final step in completing work on an Issue.

Raising an Issue first enables discussion to take place around proposals as
they take shape.  It is not uncommon for a final request to differ greatly from
an original idea after interaction in the comment stream.

So I suggest that you raise an Issue in the Schema.org repository for what you
are attempting to solve.  Try to give it a good explanatory Title, and explain
what you intend in the comment.   This is where the code in your repository and
the appspot.com working version can be very helpful in explaining and exploring
the issue.

Pull rquest When ready to request, take yourself to your repository’s home page
to create a New Pull request.  Providing you do not create a new branch in the
code, any new commits you make to your repository will become part of that Pull
Request.  A very handy feature in the real world where inevitably you want to
make minor changes just after you say that you are done!

Look out for the next post in this series – Working Within the Vocabulary – in
which I’ll cover working in the different file types that make up Schema.org
and its extensions.
