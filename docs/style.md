### Writing effective competencies and benchmarks

1. Limit each competency or benchmark to one sentence of circa 140 characters, the length of a Twitter posting.  If a thought seems to require more words, consider splitting it into two simpler thoughts.

2. Begin each competency or benchmark with an action verb.  Competencies, which are about learning and understanding, start with verbs such as _understands_, _knows_, _recognizes_, or _differentiates_.  Benchmarks, which are about doing, start with verbs such as _uses_, _expresses_, or _demonstrates, or with more task-specific verbs such as _distills_ or _converts_.

| Competencies        | Benchmarks      |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| Understands         | Uses            |
| Knows               | Expresses       |
| Recognizes          | Demonstrates    |
| Differentiates ...  | Converts ...    |

3. Spell out acronyms at least once.  Use your judgement.  In a competency index about Linked Data, frequently used acronyms such as _OWL_ and _URI_ need only be spelled out once:
   
> _Knows Web Ontology Language, or OWL (2004), an RDF vocabulary of properties and classes that extend support for expressive data modeling and automated inferencing (reasoning)._  

4. Include historical context if possible.  Linked Data technology has largely evolved over the past quarter century and continues to evolve.  Knowing the year when a technology or concept was introduced helps readers, for example: _World Wide Web (1989)_, _HTTP (1991+)_, _URIs (1994)_, _OWL (2004)_, and _Linked Data (2006)_.

5. Include enough detail to characterize the nature of competency in a domain.  Competencies and benchmarks should not aim at covering all features of a technology, in the manner of a reference manual.  Attempts at comprehensiveness risk making the CI brittle in the face of inevitable change, and they risk making the CI boring to read.

6. Draw attention to ambiguity in the definition or use of terminology.  For example, one competency reads: 
   
> _Knows that the word "ontology" is amiguous, referring to any RDF vocabulary, but more typically a set of OWL classes and properties designed to support inferencing in a specific domain_.

7. Enlarge the set of topics covered by the CI with prudence, bearing in mind that adding topic clusters enlarges the scope of the CI as a whole.  The starter set of topics for this CI were originally brainstormed at a workshop in 2012, and there is no expectation that the scope will remain static.  If new high-level topic clusters are proposed, however, consider whether they really fit into the scope of Linked Data, or whether they suggest the need for a competency index with a different scope.  The design of Knowledge Organization Systems, for example, would be a great topic for a competency index.
