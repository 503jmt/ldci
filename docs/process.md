### Help us maintain the index

Technology never ceases to change, and index is a living document.  Do you see gaps in its coverage?  Proposing new competencies or benchmarks, updates, or even just changes of wording to the Competency Index Editorial Board is a fully guided process that begins with a [single mouse click](https://github.com/dcmi/ldci/edit/master/docs/index.md).

Before making that mouse click, you must be logged into your account on [Github](https://github.com/), an astonishingly well-designed "social coding" platform used by open-source software developers and, increasingly, by collaborators on other types of project such as this competency index.  [Joining Github](https://github.com/join) is free; you will be in excellent company.

If you [log into Github](https://github.com/login) and navigate to the [Linked Data Competency Index](D2695955.md), you will see, in the upper right, a button labeled "Edit on Github".  [Clicking this](https://github.com/dcmi/ldci/edit/master/docs/index.md) will present you with the option to "fork" the [LDCI Github repository](https://github.com/dcmi/ldci).  Clicking on this button will generate your own personal copy of the repository and place you into an editor where you can make changes to the competency index.

Then type away! Add new competencies or tweak wordings.  Don't worry about the format; you are editing your own copy, so nothing will break.  When you are satisfied with your changes, give your suggestions a descriptive title, press the button to "commit" your changes, and follow the prompts to create a ["pull request"](https://github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).  This presents your proposal to the Editorial Board.  Any follow-up questions we may have will appear in a discussion thread on the webpage of the pull request and arrive by email to the address associated with your Github account.

If you merely want to raise issues related to the index, without proposing specific changes, you can do so by visiting the [issues page](https://github.com/dcmi/ldci/issues) and clicking on "New issue".  This would be the best way to suggest general changes, such as an extension of scope, or to put forward some tentative ideas for discussion.

Members of the Editorial Board wishing to propose changes should first create a branch of the repository, make the changes, then issue a pull request from the branch.
